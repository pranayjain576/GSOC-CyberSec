# GSOC-CyberSec
Hey, this is Pranay Jain from IIT Hyderabad from AI dept. I'm very enthusiastic to apply for GSoC and I would love to contribute to the Human AI community. I have completed the task given to me for the Evolution of Language among dark web users project.

I tried to incorporate as much knowledge as possible and learned a lot from the project I completed. I have uploaded 3 files here:

a) `Twitter-bully.ipynb`: This file attempts to classify comments into 3 major categories: Sexism, Racism, or none. I experimented with various models for classification, including some manually trained and some pre-trained models. I have attached the best results I could achieve. *I still intend to add more code to predict the word which significantly influenced the prediction*, but couldn't do so due to time constraints and academic workload in my college.

b) `Qanon`: I attempted to predict common words over time and how these words changed with time. I worked with pre-trained BERT, LDA, and TF-IDF methods to extract the best results.

c) `CRIME`: Here, I used data from YouTube and Twitter to predict whether it's related to bullying or not. Again, multiple models were experimented with and tested on the data.

Why Human AI?

I want to join and contribute to Human AI because, as a student in AI, I have a solid understanding of NLP, DL, and CV frameworks. I believe I can work diligently and bring out the best in me if given the opportunity to work under this organization. I'm deeply passionate about NLP and CV tasks, and I see the chance to contribute and learn extensively if selected for GSoC under this organization.
